collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-09-24-fast-waves
excerpt: 'We present a fast, large-scale algorithm for the simulation of electromagnetic waves (Maxwell&apos;s equations) in three-dimensional inhomogeneous media. The algorithm has a complexity of O(N log(N)) and runs in parallel. Numerical simulations show the rapid treatment of problems with tens of millions of unknowns on a small shared-memory cluster (≤ 16 cores).'

We present a fast, large-scale algorithm for the simulation of electromagnetic waves (Maxwell&apos;s equations) in three-dimensional inhomogeneous media. The algorithm has a complexity of O(N log(N)) and runs in parallel. Numerical simulations show the rapid treatment of problems with tens of millions of unknowns on a small shared-memory cluster (≤ 16 cores).
