excerpt: 'The Combinatorial Multigrid (CMG) technique is a practical and adaptable solver and combinatorial preconditioner for solving certain classes of large, sparse systems of linear equations. CMG is similar to Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) but replaces large groupings of fine-level variables with a single coarse-level one, resulting in simple and fast interpolation schemes. These schemes further provide control over the refinement strategies at different levels of the solver hierarchy depending on the condition number of the system being solved [1]. While many pre-existing solvers may be able to solve large, sparse systems with relatively low complexity, inversion may require O (n) space; whereas, if we know that a linear operator has ñ = 0 (n) nonzero elements, we desire to use 0 (n) space in order to reduce communication as much as possible. Being able to invert sparse linear systems of equations, asymptotically as fast as …'
