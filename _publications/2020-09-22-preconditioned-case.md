collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-09-22-preconditioned-case
excerpt: 'As the growing availability of computational power slows, there has been an increasing reliance on algorithmic advances. However, faster algorithms alone will not necessarily bridge the gap in allowing computational scientists to study problems at the edge of scientific discovery in the next several decades. Often, it is necessary to simplify or precondition solvers to accelerate the study of large systems of linear equations commonly seen in a number of scientific fields. Preconditioning a problem to increase efficiency is often seen as the best approach; yet, preconditioners which are fast, smart, and efficient do not always exist. Following the progress of [1], we present a new preconditioner for symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD) systems of linear equations. These systems are common in certain PDEs, network science, and supervised learning among others. Based on spectral support graph theory, this new …'
