excerpt: 'We present a computational technique for low-frequency electromagnetic imaging in inhomogeneous media that provides superior three-dimensional resolution over existing techniques. The method is enabled through large-scale, fast (low-complexity) algorithms that we introduce for simulating electromagnetic wave propagation. We numerically study the performance of the technique on various problems including the imaging of a strong finite scatterer located within a thick conductive box.'

We present a computational technique for low-frequency electromagnetic imaging in inhomogeneous media that provides superior three-dimensional resolution over existing techniques. The method is enabled through large-scale, fast (low-complexity) algorithms that we introduce for simulating electromagnetic wave propagation. We numerically study the performance of the technique on various problems including the imaging of a strong finite scatterer located within a thick conductive box.
