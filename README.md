# About me

I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at MIT, fortunate to be advised by [Pablo Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/). I am supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

I am currently interested in questions about polynomial nonnegativity, symmetry, and machine learning. I have previously worked on fast algorithms for imaging problems, and before academia I worked briefly in quantitative finance.

If I'm not trying to prove a theorem or squash a bug in code, I'm probably trying to learn how to do something -- maybe involving cooking in the kitchen or climbing a new route in the gym.
