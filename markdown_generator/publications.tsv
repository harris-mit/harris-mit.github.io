2019-09-24	Combinatorial multigrid: Advanced preconditioners for ill-conditioned linear systems	2019 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)	"The Combinatorial Multigrid (CMG) technique is a practical and adaptable solver and combinatorial preconditioner for solving certain classes of large, sparse systems of linear equations. CMG is similar to Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) but replaces large groupings of fine-level variables with a single coarse-level one, resulting in simple and fast interpolation schemes. These schemes further provide control over the refinement strategies at different levels of the solver hierarchy depending on the condition number of the system being solved [1]. While many pre-existing solvers may be able to solve large, sparse systems with relatively low complexity, inversion may require O (n) space; whereas, if we know that a linear operator has ñ = 0 (n) nonzero elements, we desire to use 0 (n) space in order to reduce communication as much as possible. Being able to invert sparse linear systems of equations, asymptotically as fast as …"	"Langston, M. H., Harris, M. T., Letourneau, P. D., Lethin, R., & Ezick, J. (2019, September).

2019-09-24	Fast large-scale algorithm for electromagnetic wave propagation in 3D media	2019 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)	"We present a fast, large-scale algorithm for the simulation of electromagnetic waves (Maxwell's equations) in three-dimensional inhomogeneous media. The algorithm has a complexity of O(N log(N)) and runs in parallel. Numerical simulations show the rapid treatment of problems with tens of millions of unknowns on a small shared-memory cluster (≤ 16 cores)."	"Harris, M. T., Langston, M. H., Létourneau, P.

2020-01-01	Low-Frequency Electromagnetic Imaging Using Sensitivity Functions and Beamforming	SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 13 (2)	"We present a computational technique for low-frequency electromagnetic imaging in inhomogeneous media that provides superior three-dimensional resolution over existing techniques. The method is enabled through large-scale, fast (low-complexity) algorithms that we introduce for simulating electromagnetic wave propagation. We numerically study the performance of the technique on various problems including the imaging of a strong finite scatterer located within a thick conductive box."	"Letourneau, P. D., Harris, M.

2020-09-22	Approximate Inverse Chain Preconditioner: Iteration Count Case Study for Spectral Support Solvers	2020 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)	"As the growing availability of computational power slows, there has been an increasing reliance on algorithmic advances. However, faster algorithms alone will not necessarily bridge the gap in allowing computational scientists to study problems at the edge of scientific discovery in the next several decades. Often, it is necessary to simplify or precondition solvers to accelerate the study of large systems of linear equations commonly seen in a number of scientific fields. Preconditioning a problem to increase efficiency is often seen as the best approach; yet, preconditioners which are fast, smart, and efficient do not always exist. Following the progress of [1], we present a new preconditioner for symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD) systems of linear equations. These systems are common in certain PDEs, network science, and supervised learning among others. Based on spectral support graph theory, this new …"	"Langston, M. H., Letourneau, P.
